        <p style="padding:15px;">With todayâ€™s abundance of smartphones and computer / internet access, it would prove useful
        for any business that handles scheduling of any kind (dentists, eye doctors, barber shops,
        therapists, etc.) to have some form of an online application built to handle any scheduling. <br><br>A lot
        of businesses have issues scheduling appointments and handling changes in appointments
        efficiently, with changes to schedules creating discrepancies between different employees and
        clients. Lots of businesses handle scheduling on local computer networks, or even pen and
        paper still. Our application will handle scheduling while causing as few problems for clients and
        employees as possible.</p>
